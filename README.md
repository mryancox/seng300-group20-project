Submissions go through these stages:

1. A new submission is made by an author. This is then passed to the admin for approval.

2. If approved, go to stage 3. Otherwise the submission is rejected and does not continue.

3. Once a new submission is approved, it goes to the admin's "Assign reviewers" page. In this page, the admin assigns reviewers. 
Once reviewers are assigned, the submission disappears from this page and is passed to the assigned reviewers' accounts.

4. The submission is now in reviewers' pages and they can submit feedback. Once a reviewer submits feedback, the submission disappears from 
the reviewer's page and goes back to the admin for feedback approval.

5. Once feedback is approved by the admin, the feedback is visible by the author. The author then has until the set deadline to resubmit.

6. Once the deadline is passed, the resubmit button disappears from the author's page and the submission appears in the admin's final submissions page. 
At this point, the admin can approve or deny the final submission.



New users signup process:

1. If a new user signs up as an author, the account is automatically available for sign in. 

2. Otherwise a new user must have signed up as a reviewer. If this is the case, they can enter their occupation, affiliated organization, and research area.
This information is passed to the admin and their account appears in the "approve new reviewers" page.

3. The admin can choose to approve or reject the new reviewer. If approved, the account is unlocked for login. Otherwise the account is marked as rejected.
